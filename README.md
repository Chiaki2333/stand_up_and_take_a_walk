# stand_up_and_take_a_walk
For the health of people who sit for long periods of time, this script will remind you to stand up and take a walk at regular intervals (default each 30 minutes).

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
